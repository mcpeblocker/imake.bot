# ChatBot-3

## Goals

- To have the most basic use case - responding to start button in telegram bot.

## Technical requirements

- Have a trigger defined and stored as entity
- Develop CRUD resources for entity **Trigger**
- Have a procedure defined and stored as entity
- Develop CRUD resources for entity **Procedure**
- Have a node defined and stored as entity (step of the *procedure*)
- Develop CRUD resources for entity **Node**
- Make relevant connections between *node* & *procedure* & *triggers*
- Use **linked list** data structure to establish sequence in procedure
- Listen to telegram bot updates through grammY according to registered *triggers*

## Notes

- A **procedure** is a sequence of steps - linked list could be good abstract data structure to represent it.
- A **step** of the procedure is abstracted to node of the linked list in which the method and parameters to be used are stored
- A **trigger** is connected to a pre-defined procedure and allows the functionality of it when certain event happens (like receiving command, textâ€¦)
- The most basic usage - responding to start button in telegram bot requires:
  - a trigger to listen for `/start` command in telegram bot
  - a procedure connected to the trigger to respond to the user
  - list of steps to be executed which can include `sendMessage` method with `text` parameter
