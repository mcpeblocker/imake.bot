By completing this milestone we should have

- complete workflow to independently develop features
- rest api base
- documentation and the notes for the usage of external tools

## Technical requirements

- Base for the REST API using express.js ✔
- Setting the up the postman for testing and documentation purposes ✔
- Sufficient file structure focused on the development of features ✔
- Improvement on the readme ✔

## Notes

- External application postman is used for testing and documentation purposes.
- A private workspace is created in postman platform under the name imake.bot
- Express.JS is used along with custom file structure which allows to focus on feature implementations independently via module-based approach.
